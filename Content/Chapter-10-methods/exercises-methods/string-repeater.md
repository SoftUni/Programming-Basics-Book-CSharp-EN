# Problem: String Repeater

Create a method **`RepeatString(str, count)`**, which takes parameters of type **`string`** and an integer **`n`** and returns the string, repeated **`n`** times. After this print the result on the console.

## Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|str<br>2|strstr|roki<br>6|rokirokirokirokirokiroki|

## Hints and Guidelines

Add to the method below the input string to the result that you will print:
