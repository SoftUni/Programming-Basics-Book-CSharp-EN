## What We Learned in This Chapter?

First we have learned **what is programming** - **giving commands, written in a computer language**, which the machine understands and is able to execute. We understood what is **a computer program** - it represents a **sequence of commands**, arranged one after another. We got familiar with **the language for programming C#** on a base level and how **to create simple console applications** with Visual Studio. We followed **the structure of the programming code in the lagnuage C#**, as for example, that commands are mainly given in the section **``static void Main(string[] args)``** between **the openning and closing curly parentheses**. We saw how to print with **`Console.WriteLine(…)`** and how to start our program with [**Ctrl + F5**]. We learned how to test our code in **SoftUni Judge**.

Good job! Lets get on with the **exercises**. You didn't forget, that programming is learned by writing a lot of code and solving problems, did you? Let's solve a few tasks to confirm what we have learned.
