### Problem: rectangle area

Write a C# program, which **reads** from the console **two numbers, a and b**, **calculates** and **prints** the are of a rectangle with sides **a** and **b**. 

#### Sample Input and Output

| a | b | area |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2 | 7 |  14  |
| 7 | 8 |  56  |
| 12 | 5 |  60  |

#### Hints and Guidelines

We make a new **console C# program**. To **read both of the numbers**, we use the folloing commands:

Its left to finish the program above, to calculate the area of the rectangle and to print it. Use the command that is already known to us **`Console.WriteLine()`** and put inside its brackets the multiplication of the numbers **a** and **b**. In programming, multiplication is done with the operator **`*`**.

#### Test your solution

Test your solution with a few examples. You have to receive a result, similar to this one (we enter 2 and 7 as  input and the program prints result 14 - their multiplication):

```
2
7
14
```
