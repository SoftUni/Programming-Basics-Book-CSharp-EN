# Chapter 1. First steps in programming 

In this chapter, we are going to find out **what programming is** in its core. We will get familiar with the idea of **programming languages** and we are going to take a look at the **environments for software development** (IDE's) and how to work with them, in particular with **Visual Studio**. We will write and execute our **first program** with the programming language **C#**  and after that we are going to exercise with a couple of tasks: we will create a console program, a graphical application and a web applicatation. We will learn how to  check the corectness of the solutions from this book in **the Judge system of SoftUni** and finally we will get to know some of the typical mistakes, which are often made during writing code and how to protect ourselves from them.
