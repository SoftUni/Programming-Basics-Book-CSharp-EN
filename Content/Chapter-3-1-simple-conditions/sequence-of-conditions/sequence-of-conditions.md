## Sequence of Conditions

Sometimes we need to do a sequence of conditions before we decide what actions our program will execute. In such cases, we can apply the construction **`if-else if ... -else`** **in series**. For this purpose we use the following format:

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // condition body;
}
else if (second condition)
{
    // condition body;
}
else if (third condition)
{
    // condition body;
}
…
else
{
    // else construction body;
}
```
